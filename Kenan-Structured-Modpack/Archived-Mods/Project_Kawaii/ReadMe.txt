● Changes from original 
	No prerequisite mods. Technically compatible with most tilesets, but works best with UDP or ChibiUltica.
	All of the AMTS related content now uses the vanilla crafting system and has it's own crafting category.
	To start you need [AMTS] Transmitter, [AMTS] Receiver, and 10 [AMTS] Points.
	Currently Transmitter and Receiver recipes can be autolearned at electronics 2, and along with points they can all be found in the world(refer to item_groups.json) or spawned with using one of the Cute professions.
	Craft a [AMTS] Packaging System using the items and use it to craft one of the compressed matters then craft into points and repeat.
	There is no AMTS rank implemented yet, no limit to shipping, no daily points, teleportation, or debug wands. All purchasable are autolearned recipes.
